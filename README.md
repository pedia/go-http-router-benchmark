Go HTTP Router Benchmark
========================

This benchmark suite aims to compare the performance of HTTP request routers for [Go](https://golang.org) by implementing the routing structure of some real world APIs.
Some of the APIs are slightly adapted, since they can not be implemented 1:1 in some of the routers.

Of course the tested routers can be used for any kind of HTTP request â†’ handler function routing, not only (REST) APIs.


#### Tested routers & frameworks:

 * [Beego](http://beego.me/)
 * [go-json-rest](https://github.com/ant0ine/go-json-rest)
 * [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
 * [Denco](https://github.com/naoina/denco)
 * [Gocraft Web](https://github.com/gocraft/web)
 * [Goji](https://github.com/zenazn/goji/)
 * [Gorilla Mux](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux)
 * [http.ServeMux](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeMux)
 * [HttpRouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter)
 * [HttpTreeMux](https://github.com/dimfeld/httptreemux)
 * [Kocha-urlrouter](https://github.com/naoina/kocha-urlrouter)

## Motivation

Go is a great language for web applications. Since the [default *request multiplexer*](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeMux) of Go's net/http package is very simple and limited, an accordingly high number of HTTP request routers exist.

Unfortunately, most of the (early) routers use pretty bad routing algorithms. Moreover, many of them are very wasteful with memory allocations, which can become a problem in a language with Garbage Collection like Go, since every (heap) allocation results in more work for the Garbage Collector.

Lately more and more bloated frameworks pop up, outdoing one another in the number of features. This benchmark tries to measure their overhead.

Beware that we are comparing apples to oranges here, we compare feature-rich frameworks to packages with simple routing functionality only. But since we are only interested in decent request routing, I think this is not entirely unfair. The frameworks are configured to do as little additional work as possible.

If you care about performance, this benchmark can maybe help you find the right router, which scales with your application.
